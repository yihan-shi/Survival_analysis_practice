```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r load library}
library(survival)

library(tidyverse)
library(ggfortify)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r load data}
data(veteran)
head(veteran)
```
*Kaplan Meier Survival Curve*
```{r}
# Build the standard survival object
# Kaplan Meier Survival Curve
# “+” after the time indicates censoring
km <- with(veteran, Surv(time, status))
head(km,80)
```



```{r}
# Produce the Kaplan-Meier estimates of the probability of survival 
km_fit <- survfit(Surv(time, status) ~ 1, data = veteran)

# Print the estimates for 1, 30, 60 and 90 days, and then every 90 days thereafter
summary(km_fit, times = c(1,30,60,90*(1:10)))

plot(km_fit, xlab="Days", main = 'Kaplan Meyer Plot')
```
```{r}
# survival curve by treatment
# Treatment: 1 = standard, 2 = test

veteran <- veteran %>% 
  mutate(trt = factor(trt, labels = c("standard", "test")))

km_trt_fit <- survfit(Surv(time, status) ~ trt, data = veteran)
autoplot(km_trt_fit, main = "Kaplan Meyer Plot by Treatment")
```
```{r}
# Survival by age

# Create age categorical variable
vet <- veteran %>% 
  mutate(AG = ifelse((age > 60), "OV60", "LT60"),
         AG = factor(AG),
         prior = factor(prior, labels = c("no", "yes")))

km_AG_fit <- survfit(Surv(time, status) ~ AG, data = vet)

autoplot(km_AG_fit, main = "Kaplan Meyer Plot by Age")
```

```{r}
# Survival by prior treatment
km_AG_fit <- survfit(Surv(time, status) ~ prior, data = vet)
autoplot(km_AG_fit, main = "Kaplan Meyer Plot by prior treatment")
```

*Cox Proportional Hazards Model*
```{r}
# Cox Proportional Hazards Model

# fit variate
cox <- coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ trt + celltype + karno + diagtime + age + prior , 
             data = vet)
summary(cox)
# From the summary, small cell type, adeno cell type and karno are significant.
# Caution!!
# Cox model assumes that the covariates do not vary with time (Karno varies over time)

cox_fit <- survfit(cox)
autoplot(cox_fit)
```
```{r}
# Aalen’s additive regression model
# which assumes that the cumulative hazard H(t) = a(t) + X B(t), where a(t) is a 
# time-dependent intercept term, X is the vector of covariates for the subject (possibly 
# time-dependent), and B(t) is a time-dependent matrix of coefficients.

aa_fit <-aareg(Surv(time, status) ~ trt + celltype + karno + diagtime + age + prior, 
                 data = vet)
aa_fit
autoplot(aa_fit)
```
